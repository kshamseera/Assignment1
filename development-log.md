Firstly i designed my code using a class named Appointment. It includes methods,variables,loops and control structures.After discussed with rach i separate class into a separate file.And other code included in another file called main.rb.I have done my home page and create appointment feature by checking the time availabilty using a method. Also i added one more method to view the appointment details on a perticular date.now i am challenging to write all aappointment details in a file
