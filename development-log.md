I have compleated basic plan of my app purpose,scope and features .Also i have written my psuedocode and a rough flowchart.Still i have to add user interaction and cfd in to software development plan.I also made my implementation plan in trello

I have used class and case control structure to select the different features of my app.Strated my coding for the create appointment feature. In the create feature i used variables,method and decision making statement.currently i only used one method that for the availability checking.When discussed with my educator ,got some suggessions like,to use different method for user input,and to create a separate file for the class and main,and also to do read and write all the details in to files.

now i am challenging with the file read and write.after that i have to start my other features view, delete and exit of my application

### Status Update 2 - 15/11/2019:

I continued my coding with the other features of my application.I finished write into the file.I have created different methods for each feature. As educators advice i separated all my methods into another file. After that i just started the delete feature.

when i finish my all features i have to start my test cases ,error handling,command line arguments and gem.

### Status Update 3 - 16/11/2019:

I finished my coding for all features. Now am challenging to create two test case files for my check avilability method and delete appointment method. And also i have created command line argument, by adding the flag --time, to display available booking time at the beginning of my app.Also i applied some gem like colorize, tty-prompt select.

After finishing all these i want to do my error handling and want to play with some more gem and validation.
