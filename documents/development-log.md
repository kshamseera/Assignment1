### Status Update 1 - 14/11/2019:

I have completed the basic plan of my application purpose, scope, and features.  I have written my pseudocode and drew a rough flowchart. I need to add user interaction and CFD into the software development plan. I have added implementation plans in Trello.

I have used class and case-control structure to select the different features of my application. I started my coding for the create appointment feature. In the create feature I used variables, methods, and decision-making statements. currently, I only used one method for the availability checking. When discussed with my educator, got some suggestions like, to use a different method for user input, and to create a separate file for the class and main, and also to do read and write all the details into files.

now  I am working with the file read and write. Next, I am planning to  start view, delete and exit features of the application

### Status Update 2 - 15/11/2019:

I continued my coding with the other features of my application. I finished writing into the file. I have created different methods for each feature. As educators advice, I separated all my methods into another file. After that, I just started the delete feature.
 
when I finish my all features I have to start my test cases, error handling, command-line arguments, and gem.

### Status Update 3 - 16/11/2019:

I finished my coding for all features. Now am challenging to create two test case files for my check availability method and delete the appointment method. And also I have created a command-line argument, by adding the flag --time, to display available booking time at the beginning of my app. Also, I applied some gem like colorize, tty-prompt select.

After finishing all these I want to do my error handling and want to play with some more gem and validation.

### Status Update 4 - 17/11/2019:

I have completed my terminal application coding. now I am doing my documentations. After that, I want to create ppt slides for the presentation.
